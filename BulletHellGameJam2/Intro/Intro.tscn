a  newly  discovered virus known as the core oh no virus. 
All your files  have been corrupted. You must deploy 
an antivirus program into  the system and destroy this
virus, before it completely takes over your PC, and 
renders it useless... forever. Help the antivirus 
navigate its way through the inner workings of your 
computer,  while uncorrupting files along the way. 
Collect XP Orbs to update your antivirus, making it 
faster and stronger. The virus however... it senses 
an alien presence, andit wants to eliminate this alien 
threat. Be careful and hurry up -  your computer depends 
on it.
